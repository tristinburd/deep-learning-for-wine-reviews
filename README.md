# Creating a Deep Learning Solution for Predicting Wine Reviews

This project is all about trying to build a deep-learning model to predict the wine rating based on the rating 
given by wine sommeliers.

Data for this project was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews)

This project was executed in Google Colab to take advantage of computer resources for the Deep Learning Model.
